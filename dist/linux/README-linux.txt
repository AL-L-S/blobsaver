blobsaver has two required dependencies and two optional.
Make sure to install these on your system before continuing.

Required:
  - Java 8 with JavaFX or OpenJFX
    Please see https://github.com/airsquared/blobsaver/wiki/Installing-Java
    and https://github.com/airsquared/blobsaver/wiki/Making-sure-you-have-the-right-Java-version
    if you need help making sure you have the right Java version

  - libfragmentzip (https://github.com/tihmstar/libfragmentzip)

Optional (for reading information from connected devices):
  - libimobiledevice (https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libimobiledevice)
  - libirecovery (https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libirecovery)

If you do not install these optional dependencies, blobsaver's
"Read from device" feature will not work.
